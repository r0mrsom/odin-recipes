            <h1>Chicken Adobo</h1>
            <p>Chicken adobo is a classic and iconic Filipino dish of chicken that is braised in a flavorful sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The resulting tender meat has a distinct savory, tangy, and slightly sweet profile, and is a staple in Filipino households, typically served with steamed white rice. </p>
